# Luxor-Semantic-Web-App

# Introduction
Located in Upper Egypt, Luxor has been described as the world’s biggest open air museum. Luxor stands
head-and-shoulders above Egypt's other towns for its sheer wealth of temples and tombs. It has been
estimated that Luxor contains about a third of the most valuable monuments and antiquities in the
whole world, which makes it one of this planet’s most important tourism sites. This was the site of
ancient Thebes, the great city of the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom pharaohs who covered the
banks of the Nile with their mammoth building works and began the vast tomb structures snugly hidden
amid the rocky valley of the West Bank. The scope of their ambition is best appreciated today in the
magnificent Karnak Temple complex, but there are so many monuments here that you could easily
spend a week simply soaking up the elegance and grandeur.
Luxor is one of the most popular destinations in Egypt, being one of those places that you must see.
Because of this almost every tourist company has an office somewhere in the town.

# Project Overview
If tourists don’t organize their trip via a tourism company, a lot of information would be missing and
many attractions might be hidden and not visited. A lot of tourists have interests/preferences that they
would like to have/practice during their stay. In this project you are asked to help tourists explore the
city, visit its attractions and enjoy their stay, based on their interests/preferences. You are asked to
design an ontology describing city attractions and activities. The goal is to let the tourists get the best
and enjoy their stay in Luxor. This is done by:
1. Recommending/suggesting top places and sites to visit
2. Suggesting the best time of visit
3. Suggesting restaurants with
4. Suggesting activities based on the tourist’s interests
5. Plan for the whole trip.

Tourists are not expected to know semantic web, RDF and SPARQL. Thus, the final task of the
project is to implement the frontend, friendly interface that allows tourists to create their
profile, add their interests and finally ask for suggestions and recommendations.
